Self-Assessment:

Functionality
3 - encrypt and decrypt methods working with command line interface

OOP
3 - I thought about splitting up the enigma class with inheritance or just into more classes, but in the end the entire class was not too long. There are a couple methods that have repetitive code that could definitely be refactored to be 'dry'er. I had a couple attempts at this but ultimately returned to my repetitive code for encryption and decryption.

Conventions
3 - Indentation/spacing/lines look good to me. Naming is clear. Basic structures and enumerables were used as well as a hash.

TDD
4 - All methods are tested. Test coverage shows 100% coverage. stubs are implemented in testing.

Version Control
